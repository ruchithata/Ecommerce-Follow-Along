# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Description

The **Ecommerce Follow Along** project is designed to help developers build a full-stack e-commerce web application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project follows a hands-on approach, where you will learn and implement key concepts such as **user authentication**, **product management**, and **order handling** through **RESTful APIs**. By the end of the project, you will have built a functioning e-commerce platform with core features, using JavaScript across both the client and server side.

The MERN stack allows for a seamless and efficient development process, providing a unified language (JavaScript) for the entire stack, making it easier for developers to build, scale, and maintain web applications.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this milestone, we introduced the foundations of building a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Key topics covered include:

### 1. **Overview of the MERN Stack**
   - The **MERN** stack is a popular set of technologies used for building modern, scalable, and fast web applications. The stack consists of:
     - **MongoDB** (database)
     - **Express.js** (backend framework)
     - **React.js** (frontend library)
     - **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime)
   - The key advantage of MERN is its **JavaScript-only** approach, where both the front-end and back-end are built using JavaScript, making development easier and more efficient.

### 2. **REST API Structure and Endpoints**
   - We explored **REST APIs** (Representational State Transfer) and their role in allowing communication between the client and server.
   - Key API endpoints were introduced to handle:
     - **User Authentication**: Register and log in users with secure authentication.
     - **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
     - **Order Handling**: Manage customer orders from creation to checkout.
   - These APIs interact with the database, responding with data in JSON format.

### 3. **Basics of Database Schema Design**
   - In MongoDB, **schema design** involves defining the structure of data stored in the database, including relationships between different collections such as **users**, **products**, and **orders**.
   - The schema plays a critical role in ensuring data consistency and making it easier to query.

### 4. **Role of Authentication in Web Applications**
   - Authentication verifies the identity of a user before granting access to certain features or data.
   - In this project, we focused on building **secure authentication** mechanisms, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their orders.
   - We implemented techniques like **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to securely handle user sessions.

## Features Implemented

- **User Authentication**:
  - Sign up and login features using JWT for secure sessions.
  
- **Product Management**:
  - Add, update, and view products within the e-commerce platform.

- **Order Management**:
  - Create, update, and view customer orders.




# Milestone 19: Cart Page & Quantity Management

In this milestone, we built the cart page for our e-commerce app.  
- Displayed products inside the cart using the existing backend API.  
- Added + and - buttons to increase and decrease product quantity.  
- Created backend endpoints to handle quantity updates.  
- Connected frontend buttons with the backend API for real-time updates.

# Milestone 20 - User Profile Endpoint 

## Overview
- Implemented the `/profile` endpoint to fetch user data and store it in an object. 
- Created `profile.jsx` to dynamically display all user details.  
- Ensured proper data handling and integration between frontend and backend.  
- Planned future improvements like profile editing, authentication, and UI enhancements.

## *Milestone 23: Order Placement Workflow*

Place Order Button: Added functionality in the cart page to initiate the order placement process.
Select Address Page: Developed a page displaying all user addresses with an option to select a delivery address.
Address Retrieval: Created a backend endpoint to fetch all addresses associated with a user.
